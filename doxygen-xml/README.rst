Doxygen XML hacking
===================

This is something I wrote for a little project at work. I had a bunch of C
code that was too large to fit into the flash memory of a microcontroller
and I decided that by processing XML docs generated by Doxygen, I could
come up with a list of functions that weren't being called. I did that, and
then commented out those functions, and it got me down to where I needed to
be. The usage of this library was like this::

 parsedSourceFiles = CSourceFile.parseDoxyXmlFiles('.')
 functionList = FunctionList(parsedSourceFiles)
 needed_functions = FunctionList([
         functionList.find('main'),
         functionList.find('t2_interrupt'),
         functionList.find('rtc_interrupt'),
         functionList.find('nrf_interrupt')])
 needed_functions.extendedCallTree(functionList)
 needed_functions.sort()
 
 disposable = filter(lambda x: x not in needed_functions, functionList)
 disposable.sort()
 
 print 'GET RID OF THESE'
 for x in disposable:
     print x
