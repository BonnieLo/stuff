twofishmodule-0.6:
  * Fixed a bad problem with key schedule. 
  * Jonas fixed the autoconf, made it install right on more systems.  
  * Jonas added getpass functions to cryptfile/decryptfile
  * Cleaned up the makedist process somewhat. 

twofishmodule-0.5:

   Wasn't producing the correct test vector values. Wasn't working on
big-endian machines. Switched to Counterpane 'twofish' implementation
instead of fiddling with Dr. Gladman's. Also now uses GNU autoconf mechanism
to set up & configure stuff. Somebody needs to add a test for the $PYTHONHOME
though because right now that's hard coded to its location on Red Hat 6.2
(though you can use --prefix to manually change it). A test for Python.h
location is also needed in the configure.in. 

Changes, twofishmodule-0.3 to twofishmodule-0.4:
  Changed README to reflect that Ocotillo will now
produce a /dev/urandom for systems without one. 

Changes, twofishmodule-0.2 to twofishmodule-0.3:

Changed README.ocotillo to make sure it reflected Dr. Gladman's
contribution.
Whoops, forgot cryptrand.py!

Changes, twofishmodule-0.1 to twofishmodule-0.2:

Replaced CFB8 with CFB128 as recommended stream mode.
Implemented "C" version of CFB128
Implemented routines to encrypt and decrypt files with CFB128 mode.
Wrote two wrapper routines (cryptfile and decryptfile) to use said
   API to encrypt and decrypt files on disk.
Deprecated CFB8 mode -- it will be removed from the code ASAP, due to the
  fact that CFB128 performs so much better.
