Hacking virtualenv for websites
===============================

At work we are using virtualenv to create a sandbox Python environment for
a website. It seems kinda cool and something I should learn more about. My
plan for this directory is to develop a bunch of very small trivial websites
with random combinations of technology stack stuff. All this stuff will be
in Python.

  * Django and sqlite3 (already started)
  * Django, MongoDB, MongoEngine
  * Flask and sqlite3
  * Flask, MongoDB, MongoEngine
  * Flask and Facebook authentication

My hope is to orthogonalize pieces so that it's relatively easy to check
off things on a checklist (Django vs Flask, MongoEngine vs MySQL, etc) and
press a button, and get a trivial example website. Then you'd be able to
focus on the interesting stuff. Over time, there might be APIs for web
services like Google Maps or other such things.
