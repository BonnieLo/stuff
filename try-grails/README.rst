Hacking Grails
==============

Rich and Philippe have both suggested trying Grails. Here we go.

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d1hp8n1stA  - 90-minute video tutorial
* http://grails.org/tutorials
* http://www.vogella.com/articles/Grails/article.html
* http://grails.org/Quick%20Start

Preparations:

* sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk groovys
* Unpack grails-2.2.0.zip in the home directory, or in /opt.
* In ~/.bashrc, add JAVA_HOME and GRAILS_HOME, and add $GRAILS_HOME/bin to PATH.
* . ~/.bashrc
* Start working thru Quick%20Start.

If you've been fooling with Tomcat separately, type "sudo service tomcat6 stop" so that
you don't block Grails from running its own Tomcat server.

If you see something like "Error starting Sunâ€™s native2ascii", that might mean you've
set JAVA_PATH incorrectly. It should not be set for the JRE, it should be set for the
JVM where bin/javac is.

When the tutorial app is running, you should be able to type::

 (cd my-project; grails run-app)

and then visit http://localhost:8080/my-project/book/list in the browser to see the app
maintaining a list of books.
