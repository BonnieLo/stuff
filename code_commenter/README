It would be awfully good to have this thing be knowledgeable about
the syntax of the programming language. So it really makes sense to
make this a modification of some other tool that already understands
syntax. Doxygen looks like an obvious candidate.

Doxygen already has an option for generating HTML, and it's open
source, so it should be fairly straightforward to get Doxygen to add
the Javascript to do the pop-up windows.
