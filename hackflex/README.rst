Hacking Adobe Flex
==================

At work, we write apps in ActionScript (kinda like JavaScript) and compile
them with Adobe Flex and Ant. So I need a sandbox to play with those.

I found an example but unfortunately it's trying to use an RPC service that I
don't have available. So the GUI comes up (which is really what I wanted) but
it can't communicate with the non-existent service. Maybe I can whip up some
dumb little service on Google App Engine, that might be cool.

Coming up to speed with this is going to take a while, and nobody at work has
specifically asked me to do it. Should I spend work time doing this? Will it
make me more valuable to the company?

It might be useful to be able to pinch-hit as an app developer from time to
time.
