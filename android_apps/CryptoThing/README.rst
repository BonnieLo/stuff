Android crypto app stuff
========================

The goal here is to be able to encrypt information like passwords, bank
account info, etc., and keep it on my phone or my Kindle Fire. It's easy to
set up RC4 to be secure enough for this. The trickier part is entering a
passphrase.

Entering passphrases is difficult with the crappy little keyboard on the
phone. So my thought is to allow passphrases to be entered using `speech
recognition`_ (see example_ code).
