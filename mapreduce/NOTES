This is a reference implementation for MapReduce. It's a single thread
on a single CPU, and it should be useful for putting together some
tests that can be applied to multi-CPU implementations. I think I've
made sure that orders are preserved everywhere they ought to be.

My hope is to put some tests together and then try them on Amazon's
Elastic MapReduce, to make sure I understand everything correctly, and
then I can use those tests to verify my own cluster when I'm ready to
build one.

I should more systematically journal my adventures with MapReduce.
Right now I have notes spread across Google Notebooks, OneNote, and
emails to myself, these should all be consolidated, edited for
clarity, and kept in one place.
