This is the README for Guile Web 0.5.0 (-*- text -*-)

Guile Web is Copyright (C) 2002,2003,2004,2005 Clinton Ebadi. It is a
set of modules designed to make web programming easier with Guile (in
combination with guile-www).

I. Dependencies

   A. Guile <http://www.gnu.org/software/guile> 1.6.x. Guile-Web may
      works with Guile 1.7.x, but I have yet to test it. Bug reports
      related to 1.7.x are welcome though.

   B. libcgi <http://libcgi.sourceforget.net> [used by (web session)]

   C. Optional: SimpleSQL <http://guile-simplesql.sourceforge.net/>
      [for use with the (web db) module]

II. Troubleshooting

    A. Using scheme files as CGI with Apache
       If you have problems using guile-web scripts and see something
       like: 

	     ERROR: In procedure dynamic-link: ERROR: file:
	     "libgwebsession", message: "file not found" 

       Then you need to add some stuff to httpd.conf. This may be
       slightly different for Apache 2.0 (I don't use it).

	1. Uncomment or add 
	
		LoadModule env_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_env.so'

	   to your httpd.conf (or where you put your LoadModule
           statements if you have a more complicated setup). If you
           installed Apache somewhere other than /usr, you will need
           to change /usr/lib to the approriate directory.

	2. Add 'SetEnv LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH $PREFIX/lib' where $PREFIX is
	   your install prefix for guile-web (the default install
	   prefix is /usr/local). Reload Apache's config and the error
	   should go away.

       If you are using mod_guile you will have to put:

	  (setenv "LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH" 
	    (string-append "$PREFIX/lib:"
	                   (if (getenv "LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH")
			      (getenv "LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH")
			       "")))
       
       in whatever file you set with the GuileInit option in your
       Apache configuartion for mod_guile (remember to change $PREFIX
       to the prefix you installed guile-web to).

III. Notes

     The (web db) module is only useful if you are using
     simplesql. You can get simplesql from
     http://guile-simplesql.sourceforge.net/. Simplesql is very easy
     to use database interface that can access MySQL and PostgreSQL
     databases (support for other databases is easy to add too).

     You may want to use mod_guile with your Scheme scripts because
     the overhead of starting and stopping Guile for every page hit is
     _very_ high. You can get mod_guile from
     http://sv.nongnu.org/projects/mod-guile/ .

IV. Documentation

    Documentation is provided as texinfo. To read the docs run 'info
    guile-web', use Emacs built in info browser, or whatever your
    favorite info browser is. 

    If the texinfo documentation is confusing or doesn't explain
    something thoroughly enough, please send an email to 

        clinton [at] unknownlamer.org 

    so I can make the documentation better. 

    If there are any features you want added, please send me an email
    and I'll consider it. Same goes for bugs/patches/anything. I could
    really use suggestions for interface improvements.

V. Compatibility

   A. Pre-1.0
   
	Before 1.0 any incompatible changes will result in the release
	of a new 0.N.0 release, any changes which do not break
	compatibility will result in a new 0.0.N release.

   B. Post-1.0

       After 1.0, only new features will be added. The behaviour of
       old features may be deprecated but will remain until the next
       major (N.0.0) release alongside the replacement.

VI. Related Projects

    A. Guile-WWW <http://www.glug.org/people/ttn/software/guile-www/>
       Very featureful WWW library for Guile. This is essential when
       writing CGI with Guile

    B. Guile-PG  <http://www.glug.org/people/ttn/software/guile-pg/>
       Advanced postgresql interface for Guile. This is THE database
       interface for Guile. Highly Recommended.    

    C. Guile-DBI <http://home.gna.org/guile-dbi/>
       Database Independent Interface for Guile. It works but is not
       nearly as featurely as the Perl or PHP DBI implemenations. It
       is a fairly new projects [as of 2005-05] so it should
       eventually have a fully featured interface.
