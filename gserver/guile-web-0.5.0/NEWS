See the ChangeLog for a detailed list of changes.

0.5.0:
- Removed SSAX (Guile-Lib has a working set of modules for it)
- (web xhtml): Renamed (web html) to (web xhtml)
- (web xhtml): Fixed a bug with the xhtml-tag output code (it wasn't
  passing the port to the display of the tag-tree for a non-empty tag)
- Reworked the README to make it more useful and readable

0.4.3:
- Fixed a few typos in the manual
- (web html): Converted to a new internal format
- (web html): New procedure, xhtml:tag-tree->shtml, converts a tag
  tree to shtml (as used by HtmlPrag)
- (web html): now works with Guile 1.7.1+ (again)
- (web html): it turns out that lambda* wasn't broken and the
  behaviour I was seeing is part of the spec. Oops. Work around still
  in place but it is now permanent.
- session.c compiles with newer versions of libcgi
- (web html) Fixed html tag sharing problems

0.4.2:
- (web template): Added template:set-error-handler to allow the error
  handler to be overriden
- (web template): This was broken in 0.4.1, whoops. It works now.
- (web html): This should work now; lambda* is currently broken (Guile
  1.6.4/CVS HEAD as of 2004-06-16) and I have written a work around
  (in the meantime non-empty tags will be slightly slower).

0.4.1:
- Updated documentation
- (web html) The definitions for the tags defined in this module are
  now generated at compile time instead of load time, speeding up the
  loading of this module by a fair amount.
- (web session) session:end is now named session:save (you do not have
  to stop using the session after the call so the new name makes more
  sense). session:end is provided using Guile's built in deprecation
  features; if used it will issue a warning (or be disabled entirely
  if deprecated features have been disabled in your copy of Guile)

0.4.0:
- (web template) now throws an exception with the key
  'web:template:error when a parse error occurs.
- (web session):
       * session:end must now be called at the end of a session;
         however, access to variables in the session should now be
         faster and now things should be properly serialized
       * Session support was rewritten around the new serializer
- (web serialize): The old serializer was replaced with a completely
  new one which is incompatible with the old one. This one works much
  better but still needs quite a bit of work.
- Documentation: Updated to reflect the changes to the serializer


0.3.0:
- (web db): Rewrote to have much less space/time overhead
- (web template): documented
- New module: (web template). Provides a simple page template
  language.
- (web html): New Procedure: (xhtml:tags . tags), returns a sequence
  of tags as a single tag tree.
- The FDL is now included in the manual
- (web html) is now documented (yay for automatically generating stuff)

0.2.0:

- Added support for serializing any GOOPS object
- Serialization of lists, pairs, and vectors now works properly by
  serializing each member of the container
- hash-dash: Support for <?guile ?> blocks has been removed for
  speed (there was really no point to it anyway)
- New module: (web html) that generates xhtml 1.0

0.1.1:
- Rewrote hash-dash extension and it now works! (oops)
- <?g in #- -# block is now <?guile (yes, it is longer, but it is a
  better name for a processing instruction).

0.1:
- Initial Release
