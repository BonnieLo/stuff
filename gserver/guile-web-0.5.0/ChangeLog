	tag tree)

2005-05-10  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* guile-web.texinfo (XHTML Generation): Updated manual to reflect

2005-01-05  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* html.scm (merge-atts): copy-tree tag-defaults (this fixes BUG #3)

	* html/gen-html.scm (define-tag!): define-tag! actually really
	works now. It's a bit hairer now and probably slower at compile
	time but seems faster at runtime.

2004-12-17  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* html/gen-html.scm (define-tag!): Guile 1.7's macroexpander (if
	syncase is in use) doesn't like the way the macro was defined (it
	was out of spec with Scheme, whoops). Fixed.

	* session.c: libcgi now uses libcgi/HEADER, changed includes to
	use this

2004-08-26  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	ensure that the encoding is present

	* guile-web.texinfo (XHTML Generation): Documented xhtml:tag-tree->shtml

	* html.scm (xhtml:dtd): (make <xhtml-tag-top> instead of
	<xhtml-tag> for the HtmlPrag converter (the DTD being present will
	result in *TOP* going into the HtmlPrag list)
	(<xhtml-tag>): Added three new slots (name, atts, and start-or-close)
	(display): Converted methods to use new slots and types and added a special
	method for <xhtml-top-tag> (prints the DTD)
	(empty-tag): make a <xhtml-tag-empty> object
	(non-empty-tag-start): make <xhtml-tag>
	(<xhtml-tag-list>): New class

	* guile-web.texinfo (Top): Updated version from 0.4.0 to 0.4.3 (oops)

	* html.scm (non-empty-tag): Installed a hack to work around the
	broken lambda* of Guile 1.6.4/CVS at the moment

2004-05-24  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* guile-web.texinfo (Page Templates): Added documentation for
	template:set-error-handler

	* template.scm (template:set-error-handler): Added procedure
	(handle-command): Changed tmpl:error to template:error

2004-02-27  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* guile-web.texinfo (Session Management): Changed session:end to
	session:save and expanded the blurb

	* session.scm (session:save): Renamed session:end to session:save
	(the session may continue to be used after the call; the name was
	misleading)
	(session:end): Defined as an alias for session:save that issues a
	deprecation warning. The alias will be removed some time later; it
	will already be gone if your Guile has deprecated features disabled.

	with all of the forms needed to define the tags.

	xhtml:tags

2003-12-27  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

2003-09-18  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* serialize.scm (unserial-table): Made into a vector of alists
	instead of a hash table (see comments for *session-hash-table*)
	(serialize): Made serial-table a vector of alists

	* session.scm (*session-hash-table*): Made into a vector of alists
	instead of a hash table (a hash table really is a vector of
	alists, but cannot be printed in a readable form)

2003-09-17  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* session.scm (session:start): Wraps around session:_start to use
	a global hash table of key value pairs contained within the session
	(session:end): This must be called at the end of a script that
	uses session management now (at least until I do a huge rewrite of
	serialize v2)

	* session.c (scgi_session_init): Register a few procedures with a
	preceding _ in their names

2003-09-13  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* template.scm (tmpl:error): New procedure; returns a string
	indicating that an error occured
	(template:parse): Changed one instance of error to tmpl:error so
	that leaving a template call unclosed will return the error to the
	caller at the end of the page list instead of giving control to
	the nearest catch clause for misc-error

2003-09-09  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* db.scm: Rewrote misc db utils to not use hash tables

	* guile-web.texinfo (Page Templates): Added Page Templates chapter

2003-06-24  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* session.scm: Started work on native Scheme implementation of sessions

	* new-serialize.scm: Merged in my heavily modified serializer from
	my school project

2003-06-18  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* html.scm (xhtml:tags): Added new procedure for returning a
	sequence of tags

2003-06-17  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* template.scm: Added new template parser

2003-04-24  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* html.scm (non-empty-tag-start): Removed '#:rest elements' from
	function because the tag start procedure shouldn't have any
	arguments other than the attributes (it was unused and could have
	led to subtle bugs I suppose).

2003-04-03  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* guile-web.texinfo (XHTML Generation): Fixed a typo on the
	example (missing a paren at the end)

2003-02-19  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* hash-dash.scm (hash-dash): Removed support for <?guile ?> blocks

2002-12-11  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* serialize.scm (serialize): for <list>s now serializes
	each member of the list
	(serialize): for <pair>s the car and cdr are now serialized
	(serialize): for <vector>s now serializes each member of the vector
	(<list>): New unseralizer for lists
	(<vector>): New unseralizer for vectors
	(<pair>): New unserializer for pairs
	(serialize-list): Added a new function so that serialize for pairs
	can call this if the pair it was passed was really a list and not
	a pair (since lists are also pairs). serialize for lists also uses
	this now. This makes the output of serializing a list /much/
	smaller
	(serialize): Added serializer for boolean values

2002-12-10  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* serialize.scm (serialize): Added serialize method for <object>
	(serialize): added quote to class names in default serializers
	(<object>): Added an unserializer for types of <object>
	(unserialize): Return #f instead of *unspecified* if
	serialize-objected isn't really a serialized object

2002-09-07  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* hash-dash.scm: Redefined skip-while from input-parse.scm to
	return a pair with the first non-skipped char and a list of all
	the skipped characters

2002-09-01  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* form.scm: Added (web form) module

2002-08-30  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* hash-dash.scm: Fixed a bug in #- -# where a <?guile ?> block
	with a quote mark next to the ending ?> would make everything die
	horribly. The solution makes #- -# even slower...(now I have to
	call my-escape-string on each string that checks if each element
	is char=? to #\" and then returns a new string that is properly
	escaped).

2002-08-15  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* hash-dash.scm (hash-dash): Works now. Wooo. Time to make the
	0.1.1 release.
	You must now use <?guile instead of <?g

2002-07-25  Clinton Ebadi  <clinton@unknownlamer.org>

	* hash-dash.scm (chunk-str): Fixed a few bugs
	Rewrote hash-dash to use Oleg's string tokenizer. The new code is
	much nicer.
