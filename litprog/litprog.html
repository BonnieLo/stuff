<b><i>What exists today in Mediawiki</i></b><p>
There is a
<a href="http://en.literateprograms.org/LiteratePrograms:Welcome">Literate
Programming wiki</a> already in existence, but the code for it is
inaccessible, and it appears to be underutilized and unmaintained. I'd
like to see something that can be applied easily to any Mediawiki
anywhere.<p>

I think a good starting point is the <a href="">GeSHi</a> Mediawiki
extension, which does syntax highlighting for a large number of
programming langauges. Mediawiki extensions are well maintained and
supported. So ideally I'd like something that can be packaged into a
single extension, probably a fork of the GeSHi extension.

<b><i>Weaving in Javascript</i></b><p>
This is a literate programming hack, in roughly the spirit
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb">noweb</a>. The weaving
process is being done in Javascript. You can see the code by viewing the
HTML source for this page in your browser. In Firefox, that's in the "View"
menu at the top.<p>

First we have a main routine into which other code snippets will be
included. This is code snippet A, indicated by the notation
"<*A*>=...code...". Two other snippets are being included in it, B and
C.

<!------- HERE IS THE A PIECE ----------->
<blockquote>
<pre>
<*A*>=
def main():
    <*B*>
    return 4

<*C*>
</pre>
<script language="javascript">
codeBits["A"] =
"def main():\n" +
"    <*B*>\n" +
"    return 4\n" +
"\n" +
"<*C*>\n";
</script>
</blockquote>
<!------- END OF THE A PIECE ----------->

What you can't see on the plain HTML page is that there is some
Javascript associated with this definition of "<*A*>", which puts it
in a Javascript array. This allows the code to later be weaved
together, the LP term for putting the B and C parts into the correct
places in the A part. There could be deeper nestings as well.<p>

In Python, indentation is important, so the Javascript weaving process
is careful to preserve indentation. When we include the B piece in A,
the four spaces before the "<*B*>" marker are pre-pended to each line
in the B piece. That way, any indentation that we used in B will be
preserved, wherever the B code is used.

<!------- HERE IS THE B PIECE ----------->
<blockquote>
<pre>
<*B*>=
for i in range(10):
    print "hello world", foo()
</pre>
<script language="javascript">
codeBits["B"] =
"for i in range(10):\n" +
"    print \"hello world\", foo()\n";
</script>
</blockquote>
<!------- END OF THE B PIECE ----------->

Finally, the C piece of code.

<!------- HERE IS THE C PIECE ----------->
<blockquote>
<pre>
<*C*>=
def foo():
    return \", goodbye world\"
</pre>
<script language="javascript">
codeBits["C"] =
"def foo():\n" +
"    return \", goodbye world\"\n";
</script>
</blockquote>
<!------- END OF THE C PIECE ----------->

<b><i>Adding this hack to GeSHi</i></b><p>
To make this work, GeSHi will need to detect code snippets
(not too hard) and then add bits of Javascript to what it already
produces.
