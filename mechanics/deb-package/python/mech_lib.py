'''
Library of 3D parts for mechanical simulation and animation.

Each part instance has:
* a set of parameters (things like thickness, radius...)
* color and material
* an initial position and orientation
* outputs for different purposes
** ODE models for simulation
** Pov-RAY models for animation
** wireframe representation for quick placement
